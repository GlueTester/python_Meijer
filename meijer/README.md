# python_Meijer

- What: Reverse engineered API for Meijer apps & services.
- Why: I can't actually get in contact with a Meijer Engineer. Their Facebook team just "takes feedback."
  On n'est jamais servi si bien que par soi-mÃªme. 
- How: [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/), Python with [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

## Motivation

The Meijer "[Shop & Scan](https://www.meijer.com/content/content.jsp?pageName=shopandscan&icid=HP:OLA:062418:MoreWays:ShopandScan)" feature is pretty cool, however it has a lot of room for improvement.

- The barcode scanner is in software and slow. It also misreads the barcode often.
- Hand held barcode scanners [are cheap, fast and accurate](https://www.amazon.com/TaoTronics-Bluetooth-Portable-Processor-Compatible/dp/B06VV65V89/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1542388719&sr=8-4&keywords=bluetooth+barcode).
- It's hard to flip between your shopping list and the app.
- You can't "parallel" shop with kids or SO. If you both start a shop and scan and try to checkout it'll only import the last one. (We found this one out the hardway).

Decompiling the Meijer.apk it looks like it's mostly just a REST app. So I setup a mitmproxy to watch for traffic. 

End goal is for Meijer PR/Engineering to either incorporate my ideas or me to have my own shopping tool, whichever comes first.


## Tools.

- [HTC One M7](https://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-one-m7/).
- Android 6. [Android 7.0+ makes it very difficult to use self signed certs](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2054#issuecomment-281836486). It's just easier to have an old device laying around for MITM proxy. It is still possible but requires root and more steps than "Install Cert".
- [Meijer Mobile App apk](https://apkpure.com/meijer/com.meijer.mobile.meijer) [[Google Play Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meijer.mobile.meijer&hl=en_US)]
- apk decompiler:
  - [Online Android Apk decompiler](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk)
  - [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)
- Jupyter Notebook as a development environment.

## Lessons Learned

### You can't trick the Meijer App with mock locations.

Tests for Mock Location, in:

5.1.2:

```mobile/meijer/com/meijergo/utils/location/LocationHelper.java```:


```
public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {
    if (location != null) {
        if (location.hasAccuracy()) {
            if (this.sessionEnv == SessionEnvironment.PRODUCTION && location.isFromMockProvider()) {
                this.listener.onLocationReceived(0.0d, 0.0d, 0.0f);
            } else {
                this.listener.onLocationReceived(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), location.getAccuracy());
            }
        }
    }
}
```
    
5.3.0:

They updated it to give you a warning that Mock Locations are not allowed.

```
public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {
    if (location == null) {
        requestLocation();
        return;
    }
    LocationHelperListener locationHelperListener = this.listener;
    if (locationHelperListener != null) {
        locationHelperListener.onLocationReceived(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), location.isFromMockProvider());
    }
}
```
