    "# Reverse Engineering Meijer Shop & Scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meijer has added a feature called 'shop and scan' to their app.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.meijer.com/content/content.jsp?pageName=shopandscan\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to use your cell phone camera to take a picture of a barcode, have a 'shopping cart' and then check out fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is a good 'beta' there are multiple design flaws. The biggest design flaw is *requiring* the cell phone's camera to scan the barcode. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It's slow, decoding is done in software and not an ASIC/FPGA.\n",
    "- In store lighting conditions make some barcodes hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "[mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) is a free and open source interactive HTTPS proxy. By sniffing all traffic in and out of the Meijer app I hope to discover a way to make my own better app just using Meijer's public, undocumented APIs."
